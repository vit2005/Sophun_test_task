# SimplePopupManager

The PopupManager is a simple and efficient Unity asset for managing popup windows in your Unity application. It handles the loading, instantiation, initialization, and release of your popups, leveraging Unity's Addressable Asset System.

## Features

- Load popups from Unity's Addressable Asset System.
- Instantiation of popups as GameObjects.
- Initialize your popups with any parameters you need using `IPopupInitialization`.
- Support for multiple `IPopupInitialization` components per popup.
- Efficient management of active popups.
- Clean release of popups from memory when they're closed.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the Addressable Asset System installed in your Unity project. If not, you can add it through the Unity Package Manager.
2. Create your popup prefabs and make sure they have components that implement `IPopupInitialization` for initialization with custom params.
3. Mark your popup prefabs as Addressable assets with their names as their address.

## Usage

1. Instantiate the `PopupManager`:
    ```csharp
    IPopupManagerService PopupManager = new PopupManagerService();
    ```
2. Open a popup:
    ```csharp
    PopupManager.OpenPopup("PopupName", param);
    ```
3. Close a popup:
   ```csharp
   Game.PopupManager.ClosePopup("PopupName");
   ```

## Interface - `IPopupInitialization`

All popup components that need to initialize themselves should implement this interface. The `Init` method will be called when the popup is opened, with the parameters provided in the `OpenPopup` method.
```csharp
    public interface IPopupInitialization
    {
        Task Init(object param);
    }
```
